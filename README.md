# switch-tab-or-pane

Atom package to change key bindings `cmd-alt-{arrow}` to switch also panes and not only tabs. When the active tab is the first/last one, it'll switch to the previous/next pane instead of cycling over current pane tabs. Except when it's the first/last pane, then it'll cycle over tabs throughout all panes as reasonably expected.

Work in progress: add support for up/down. Currently this is a limitation in Atom (1.15.0). This package is not yet published in the registry.
